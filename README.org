* Introduction
  The enhanced OAI server is a Java Servlet web application that
  implements the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata
  Harvesting (OAI-PMH) v2.0. It is based on [[http://oclc.org/research/activities/oaicat.html][OAICat]] and the [[https://github.com/EKT/Biblio-Transformation-Engine][Biblio
  Transformation Engine]]. More than the flexibility it allows with BTE
  (custom filter and modifiers), it allows the administrator to define
  metadata mappings using XSLTs and that way to support easily more
  metadata formats.

* How to use the library

  The enhanced OAI server uses the [[http://maven.apache.org/][apache maven]] tool for building
  and dependency resolution.

** Getting the jar from the central maven repository

   Include in the dependencies section of the pom.xml of your project
   the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>gr.ekt</groupId>
  <artifactId>enhancedoai</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
#+END_SRC

** Building from source
   Clone this git repository
   (https://github.com/EKT/EnhancedOAIServer), and use maven install
   to add the enhanced OAI server in your local maven repository:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/EKT/EnhancedOAIServer
cd EnhancedOAIServer
mvn package
mvn install
#+END_SRC

  automatically, so probably you will not need to concern yourself
  with them, but they are recorded here for reference.
